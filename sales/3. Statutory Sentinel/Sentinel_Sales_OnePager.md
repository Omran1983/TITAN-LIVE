# Statutory Sentinel Module (The "Penalty Shield")
**"Never pay a fine again."**

### The Problem
Mauritius statutory deadlines are strict.
Miss a date? **5% Surcharge instantly + Rs 2,000/day penalty.**
Owners rely on accountants, but accountants are busy. **Surprises happen.**

### The Solution: We watch the calendar for you.
We are your "Compliance Alarm Clock".
Unlike your accountant (who files), our job is to **remind you to approve and pay** before it's too late.

### What You Get
*   [x] **Monthly Deadline Watchdog**: Checks NPF, NSF, PAYE, VAT dates.
*   [x] **WhatsApp Alerts**: Day -7, Day -3, Day -1 ("Urgent").

### Automations Included
