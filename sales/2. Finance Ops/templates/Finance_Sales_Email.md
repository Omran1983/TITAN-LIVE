Subject: Stop chasing invoices (I'll do it for you)

Hi [Name],

I know the worst part of running [Company Name].
It's not the work. It's chasing the money *after* the work.

Sending invoices late?
Awkward follow-up calls?
Not knowing who owes what?

I’ve built a simple **Finance Review Engine** that fixes this without you lifting a finger.

**How it works:**
1. You send me your sales list (Excel/WhatsApp).
2. I professionally generate and send the PDF invoices.
3. My system automatically chases debtors (Day 1, 7, 14) so you don't have to be the "bad guy."
4. You get a weekly "Cash Snapshot" showing exactly who owes what.

**Cost:**
Rs 5,000 setup. Then just Rs 2,500/month.

Want to see a sample?
Reply "CASH" and I'll send you a demo invoice and the reports you'll get.

Best,
[Your Name]
