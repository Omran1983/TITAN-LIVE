## Section: The chaos we solve

Most recruitment agencies run on:

- Multiple Excel files,
- WhatsApp chats,
- Email threads.

By the time someone answers "How many workers are active for this employer?", the data may already be outdated.

Common pain points:

- No single source of truth.
- No visibility on who is where.
- No monitoring when the "system" fails.
- Dependency on one or two people who "know all the files".

ReachX Pilot is designed to reduce that chaos without forcing you into a full system migration on day one.

## Section: What the ReachX Pilot includes

During the 14-day pilot, you get:

- A live web dashboard showing:
  - Workers,
  - Employers,
  - Dormitories.

- Automatic sync from your Excel/CSV, so your team keeps using what they know.

- Continuous technical health checks on:
  - Database connectivity,
  - Data sync jobs,
  - Dashboard availability.

- 14 days of guided setup and usage, fully remote.

You keep control of your data, we provide structure and monitoring.

## Section: How the 14-Day Pilot works

1. We share a simple Excel/CSV template.
2. You copy or export your current data into it.
3. We set up your ReachX cockpit and load your data.
4. Your team uses it for real operations for 14 days.
5. We review the results together and decide whether to continue.

If you decide not to continue, your data remains yours and the pilot ends with no hard feelings.

## Section: Reliability

We design ReachX so that if something fails, we see it.

Our pattern includes:

- Database heartbeats:
  - Regular checks against the database and key tables.

- Sync job monitoring:
  - Logs and status for each data sync run.

- Dashboard availability checks:
  - Periodic pings to the public URL.

- A status snapshot:
  - One command that summarizes the last heartbeat, last sync and last UI check.

We do not promise perfection, but we do promise that nothing breaks silently.
