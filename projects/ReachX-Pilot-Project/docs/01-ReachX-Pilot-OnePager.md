# ReachX Operations Cockpit â€“ 14-Day Pilot

## Who this is for

Recruitment and manpower agencies who manage workers, employers and dormitories across cities or countries, and are tired of chasing Excel files and WhatsApp messages to understand what is really going on.

Typical situations:

- One or more people maintain critical Excel files.
- Management keeps asking for updated numbers.
- No one is 100% sure which worker is where.
- There is no central place to see workers, employers and dormitories together.

## 1. What you get in 14 days

### a) Live Operations Dashboard

You get access to one secure online dashboard that shows:

- Workers
- Employers
- Dormitories / accommodation

You can:

- Filter by employer, country, city, status.
- Quickly see how many workers are in each place.
- Access from any modern browser (desktop or mobile).

### b) Auto-Sync from Your Existing Sheet

We do not force you into a new system on day one.

- You keep using your **master Excel/CSV** as your central data file.
- Our system reads that file on a schedule and updates the dashboard.
- Your team continues their existing workflow, with less confusion.

### c) Built-in Health Monitoring

Behind the scenes, we run checks to avoid "silent failures":

- Database connectivity checks (Heartbeat)
- Data sync job checks (Autopilot + Refresh scripts)
- Dashboard availability checks (UI Ping)

If something fails, we have a log entry and a clear signal.  
You are not relying on someone noticing that "the numbers look wrong" a week later.

## 2. What we need from you

To start the pilot, we ask for:

1. **Your data in our template**  
   - We provide a simple Excel/CSV template for workers, employers and dormitories.
   - Your team fills it in or maps your existing columns once.

2. **One point of contact**  
   - A single person on your side who can answer data questions and coordinate feedback.

3. **Basic branding details (optional)**  
   - Your logo and brand colours if you want the dashboard to look like your own.
   - If not provided, we can run it with a neutral design.

## 3. Pilot timeline

### Day 1â€“3 â€“ Setup & onboarding

- We confirm the structure of your data.
- You send us the completed templates or mapped files.
- We load your initial data into the system.
- We confirm that the first version of the dashboard matches your expectations.

### Day 4â€“10 â€“ Live usage

- Your team uses the dashboard in real operations.
- We run scheduled syncs from your Excel/CSV to keep data fresh.
- We make small adjustments to fields or filters if required.

### Day 11â€“14 â€“ Review & decision

- We review:
  - What worked well.
  - What was confusing or missing.
  - Any technical issues and how they were handled.
- We provide a simple summary: uptime, data volumes, issues.
- Together, we decide on next steps.

## 4. After the pilot

At the end of the 14 days, you can choose:

### Option A: Continue on an ongoing plan

- We keep hosting and monitoring your ReachX cockpit.
- We maintain the data sync and health checks.
- We add improvements based on your needs.
- Pricing: a simple monthly fee based on the number of workers/employers and complexity.

### Option B: Pause with no hard feelings

- You keep your data in your own files.
- If we have extra data stored, we can export it for you.
- We can restart a similar pilot later if needed.

## 5. How we keep things reliable

We do not promise that "nothing will ever break".  
We promise that:

- We continuously check the core parts of the system.
- We log every sync job.
- We can see when something is wrong and act on it.

In practice:

- Automatic **database heartbeats**: we check that the database responds and that key tables have data.
- **Autopilot job**: we run your data sync from CSV to database on a schedule.
- **UI ping**: we confirm that the public dashboard URL is responding.
- **Status script**: we can see the latest status in one command.

This pattern is the same one we use to monitor our own systems, adapted to the size of a pilot.
