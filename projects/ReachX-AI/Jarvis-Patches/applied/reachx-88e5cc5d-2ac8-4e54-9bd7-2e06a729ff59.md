Sure thing! Here's an example of how you might refactor your React app for use with SUPABASE using .env files and JavaScript errors in ReachX UI pages respectively as examples.  This is a broad guideline that can be adapted to suit other projects or specific requirements, but hopefully it provides some starting points:

**1) Configuring the Environment Variables (.env file):**
In your project root directory create an .env and set up SUPABASE_URL & REACT_APP_* variables as follows in a manner that maintains consistency throughout all development environments.  It is also advisable to remove sensitive data such as API keys or passwords from the env files for security reasons:
```sh
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<Your Supabase Anon Key>   // Sensitive, keep hidden in .gitignore and not exposed publicly.  Remove after use only once to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive data on public platforms like GitHub or other code repositories.   
REACT_APP_SUPABASEURL = "<Your Supabase URL >"     (You can set this variable directly in the .env file)   // This is a good place for static strings because they won't change too often, otherwise you might want to use an environment-variable or config.
```
The `REACT_APP_*` variables are used by create react app with webpack and Tailwind CSS when compiling the application during development process which makes it easier in a production setting because they get replaced at runtime based on what's declared for each variable (i e, React-app will take those values).
After you have set up your .env file make sure to use `.env` files instead of hardcoded SUPABASE_URL and REACT APP keys in JavaScript every time a page is loaded due the nature that it's dynamically changing based on runtime variables (React Context or Redux).
Include this line at top:  import dotenv/load for loading .env file to process.env which will be available through all your files after load, and can read from '.env'.  
**Note that you must have the correct permissions on how SUPABASE_URL is being set up within React-App or it would not work at runtime due its dynamic nature (i e., if there's a different URL in production then also need to use .env variables for all references).  The sensitive data should be removed once you are sure they have been appropriately protected.**
```jsx harmony    //example of importing   React from 'react'; const supabaseUrl = process.env['REACT_APP_{SUPABASEURL}'] || "default-url"; ```  (Note: replace {SupaBased url variable name } with the correct one)
**2) Updating JSX files to use environment variables in .jsx or js file and also updating hardcoded SUpabase_* values as per above. Include necessary changes into your existing codebase including any React hooks (like `useState`, etc.) that rely on the env vars for proper functioning after being updated with dynamic ones:**
```sh   //example of usage in .jsx file or js files  state = useSupabase('getUser', {userId : id}) if(state.error){ alert("Failed to fetch user data")} else{/* do something here */} ` (Note the correct SUPABASE_* calls)
```   Repeat this for all existing .jsx or js files in your project and replace any hardcoded values with dynamic ones, both at declaration time as well as when they are used.  Include file paths relative to repo root directory: **(i e., `./src/components/*`)**
Remember not too late that using .env over environment variables may lead you into a world of version control problems and the real-world deployment issues (like deploying your code on shared hosting, etc.). So always make sure to understand these points thoroughly.  It's best for all development environments like production as well depending upon necessity use different files/methods in accordance with needs or requirements.
