Sure, I can help you with that by providing some sample instructions on how to clean up ReachX UI environment for SUPABASE usage and point out potential issues in your current setup which might need a change before proceeding further using unified diff or file-by-file snippets. 

1) Cleanup the .env files: The `F:\Reachx_AI\` directory has an example of how you should set up environment variables, and SUPABASE credentials in there to start your project on local development server (using NginX). You will need some sort of script or command line utility here. 
   - Find all instances where `SUPABASE_*_URL` is used within the Reachx UI app codebase, and replace them with correct values from .env file at runtime using a tool like DotEnv to manage environment variables in NodeJS/JavaScript (npm install dotenv). 
   - For example: Instead of `SUPABASE_CLIENT_ID` or any other hardcoded SUPABASE_* variable, use process.env('YOURENVVARIABLE') where YOURENVVARIABLE is your environment-specific .env file's name (i.e., development for dev env and production etc). 
   - Also make sure to include all necessary files in the project so they are available at runtime using something like dotenv or any other method depending on what you use, such as webpack aliases if your build process is configured that way by default (it seems from `F:\Reachx_AI\package.json`). 
   - After making these changes in .js file(s), ensure to run test cases using a tool like Jest or Mocha for unit testing and make sure everything still works as expected after the update/changes are implemented into your production codebase (if possible, this might be necessary before you deploy). 
   
2) Checking SUPABASE JS SDK errors: If there's any error in use of `SUPABASE_JAVASCRIPT_*` or similar values within the ReachX UI app codebase (perhaps due to incorrect setup), then these need further review, as well. 
   - This would be done using an SDK inspection tool like Screaming Frog's Supabase CLI inspect command which can help in checking your supabse sdk usage and detecting errors or issues that might affect the functionality of application (this is not a standard task for clean up process, but may assist with finding such cases). 
   - After fixing these potential problems before you proceed further to ensure all functionalities work as expected. If there are no immediate clear-cut points in codebase due which this could need change at least once per file (this can be a tricky task), then it would require some manual inspection and might not lead into clean up process, but rather point out potential issues or possible areas for improvement to the team working on project.
   
Hopefully I've provided these sample instructions in English due to space restrictions there already! For more detailed help with actual implementation specifics of such tasks you should consider contacting a professional developer who is familiar enough into your existing setup and software development process, or even hire someone experienced engineer if task complexity allows it.
