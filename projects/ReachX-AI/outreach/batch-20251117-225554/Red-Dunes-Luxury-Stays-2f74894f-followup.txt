Subject: Quick follow-up – recruitment support for Red Dunes Luxury Stays

Hi,

Just a quick follow-up on my previous email about supporting Red Dunes Luxury Stays with Gulf-region hospitality recruitment.

I know your team is busy, so I’d be happy to keep this simple:
- Share a concise overview of how we work.
- Align on 1–2 priority roles where we could add value.
- Run a small trial so you can judge us purely on candidate quality and speed.

If you are not the right contact for recruitment partnerships at Red Dunes Luxury Stays, I’d appreciate it if you could point me to the right person.

Thanks in advance, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
