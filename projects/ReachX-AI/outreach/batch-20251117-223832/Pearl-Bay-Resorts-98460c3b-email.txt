Subject: Strategic recruitment support for Pearl Bay Resorts

Hi Hiring Team at Pearl Bay Resorts,

My name is Omran from A-One Global Resourcing Ltd (Mauritius). We specialise in connecting qualified talent with Gulf-region hospitality brands similar to yours.

I believe this could become a strong additional channel for your upcoming roles.

What we can bring to your organisation:
- Pre-screened candidates for hotel and resort roles (front office, F&B, housekeeping, and support).
- Structured shortlists so your team reviews fewer CVs but higher-quality profiles.
- Coordinated communication to keep both your HR team and candidates aligned.

If you are open to it, I’d like to:
1) Understand your current and upcoming hiring needs for the next 3–6 months.
2) Share how we can plug into your process with minimal friction.
3) Propose a small initial trial so you can evaluate us on results, not promises.

Would you be available for a short call in the coming days to discuss this?

Best regards,
Omran Ahmad
