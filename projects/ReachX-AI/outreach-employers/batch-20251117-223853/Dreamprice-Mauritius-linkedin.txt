Hi,

I’m Omran, running A-One Global Resourcing Ltd in Mauritius. We support employers like Dreamprice with blue-collar and frontline staffing (drivers, warehouse, construction, retail and hospitality roles) in Mauritius.

I’d like to connect and see if there’s scope to help you stabilise staffing for recurring roles and peak periods.

If you’re the right person to discuss staffing support, I’d be happy to share a concise overview and a small trial approach. Otherwise, I’d appreciate being pointed to the appropriate contact.

Best regards,
Omran
