Subject: Support for Retail staffing at Dreamprice

Hi,

My name is Omran from A-One Global Resourcing Ltd (Mauritius). We focus on supplying reliable blue-collar and frontline staff for employers in Mauritius, especially in areas such as construction, retail, hospitality and logistics.

The main problems we see for companies like Dreamprice are:
- Time wasted reviewing unsuitable CVs.
- Last-minute shortages of staff when projects or shifts ramp up.
- Difficulty maintaining a stable pool of workers for recurring roles.

This is exactly where we can help:
- Building and maintaining a pool of workers for roles such as drivers, warehouse staff, helpers, machine operators, housekeeping staff and general labour.
- Doing the initial screening so you only see candidates who match your basic requirements.
- Aligning with your shift patterns and projects so you have a more predictable pipeline of staff.

I’d like to propose a very small, low-risk trial:
1) We agree on 1–2 roles where you have recurring demand.
2) We supply a shortlist of pre-screened candidates.
3) You evaluate us based on reliability, response time and fit.

Would you be open to a short call to see if this could support Dreamprice over the next few months?

Best regards,
Omran Ahmad
