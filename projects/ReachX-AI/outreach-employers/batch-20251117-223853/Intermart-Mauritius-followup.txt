Subject: Quick follow-up – blue-collar staffing for Intermart

Hi,

Just a quick follow-up on my previous email about supporting Intermart with blue-collar and frontline staffing in Mauritius.

Even if you already have internal recruitment, we can add value by:
- Taking care of initial sourcing and screening for agreed roles.
- Providing a flexible pool of workers when you have peaks in demand.
- Reducing the time your team spends chasing candidates who do not show up or are not suitable.

If you are not the right person to discuss this at Intermart, I’d appreciate it if you could point me to the relevant contact.

Thanks in advance, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
