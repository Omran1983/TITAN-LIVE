Hi, this is Omran from A-One Global Resourcing Ltd in Mauritius.

We help employers like XYZ Construction Ltd with blue-collar and frontline staffing in Mauritius (drivers, warehouse staff, helpers, construction workers, hotel staff, etc.).

The idea is simple:
- We build and maintain a pool of workers for the roles you choose.
- We handle initial screening.
- You get a smaller, better shortlist when you need people.

If this could be useful for your operations, could you share the best contact to speak with about staffing, or a good time for a quick call?

Thanks,
Omran
