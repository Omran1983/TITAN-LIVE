1. **Phase 1: Conceptualization & Design (Month 1)** - $20,000
   - Initial research and planning.
   - Development of detailed design specifications.
   
2. **Phase 2: Production & Installation (Months 2-3)** - $30,000
   - Manufacturing of the solar tracking system and desalination plant components.
   - Site preparation and installation.

3. **Phase 3: Commissioning & Testing (Month 4)** - $5,000
   - Final system integration and testing.
   - User training and documentation.

### Risk Management

To mitigate potential financial risks, we have implemented the following measures:

- **Detailed Budget Planning**: A thorough budget planning process has been conducted to ensure that all expenses are accurately estimated and accounted for.
- **Contingency Fund**: A contingency fund of 10% (i.e., $5,000) has been set aside to address any unexpected costs or challenges during the project execution.

### Financial Impact

The financial investment in this project is expected to yield significant benefits:

- **Reduction in Carbon Emissions**: By reducing reliance on grid electricity, our system will significantly decrease carbon emissions.
- **Cost Reduction**: Providing a more affordable desalination solution for remote coastal communities, enabling access to clean water without substantial upfront investment or recurring maintenance costs.

By securing the necessary financial resources and implementing robust risk management strategies, we are confident in the successful execution of this innovative project.
