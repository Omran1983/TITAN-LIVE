**Headline:** We monitored our own operational health for 1,000 hours. Here’s what we found.

**Body:**
Operations break silently. Security drifts when you aren’t looking.
We built an internal "Immune System" for our own company (TITAN) to catch these issues before they became incidents.

It works. It caught 3 critical drifts last week alone.

We are now opening this **System Health Audit** to a small group of SMEs.
It’s not a consulting gig. It’s an automated deep-scan of your operational, security, and process health.

*   **What you get:** A generated Risk & Compliance Report.
*   **What you don’t get:** Sales calls or "AI" hype.
*   **Cost:** $49 one-time.

If you are running lean and worried about what you’re missing, let us run the scan.
