# Operations Assets: Private Sector Employment Compliance
**Focus:** Remuneration Regulations, WRA, Statutory Checks.
**Target:** SMEs (5-60 staff).

---

## 0. "Red Flag" Pivot (Internal Note)
*   **Correction:** We do NOT sell "PRB Compliance" to private businesses. PRB is for public sector/private secondary schools.
*   **Correct Pitch:** "Employment Compliance Check" (WRA + Remuneration Orders + ERA + Data Protection).

## 1. Data Protection & Permit Check
*   **Permit:** No special license needed to offer "HR Reporting".
*   **Data Protection:** You ARE processing personal data.
    *   **Action:** Register with Data Protection Office (DPO) as a Controller.
    *   **Website:** Add "Privacy Notice" (Purpose-limited processing, retention choice).

## 2. Intake Form Strategy (Checkboxes)

*   [ ] Overtime & working hours checks
*   [ ] Inspector-ready audit pack (PDF)
*   [ ] NPF/NSF/PRGF tracker

## 3. Communication Pack (Emails)

### Email 1 — Cold Outreach (The "Risk" Angle)
**Subject:** Quick check: are you on the correct Remuneration Regulations for your staff?

Hi [Name],

Quick question: are your staff being paid strictly according to the **correct Remuneration Regulations/Order for your sector**, or are you using a generic wage structure?

Many Mauritius SMEs discover gaps only when an inspector requests evidence (contracts, leave registers, overtime calculations, payslips).

**AOGRL ComplianceOps** delivers a managed monthly compliance report:
*   Remuneration Regulations/Order mapping + wage checks
*   Overtime / working hours risk flags
*   HR documentation checklist + templates
*   Inspector-ready PDF audit pack (with report ID)

**Process:** Spreadsheet in → PDF report out (48h business days).

If you want, I can send you a **sample PDF** so you can see exactly what the output looks like.

Regards,
**Omran Ahmad**

### Email 2 — Follow-up (Sample Offer)
**Subject:** Sample report for [Company]?

Hi [Name],

Just checking if you want the **sample inspector-ready PDF**.
If you reply with: **sector + employee count**, I’ll send the sample + the template today.

### Email 3 — "Setup Fee" Filter
**Subject:** We can set you up for Rs 5,000 (one-off)

Hi [Name],

To keep this simple, we start with a **Rs 5,000 one-off setup**:
*   map your payroll sheet once
*   confirm sector ruleset scope
*   generate your first report format

Then it’s monthly (by employee band).
Want the onboarding pack?

## 4. Sales Pitch Scripts

### WhatsApp Opener (Ultra Short)
"Hi [Name] — quick one: are your staff aligned to the **correct Remuneration Regulations/Order** for your sector? We run a monthly compliance check (spreadsheet in → PDF out) in **48h**. Want a **sample report**?"

### Phone Script (60 Seconds)
1.  "Which sector are you in and how many staff?"
2.  "Most issues happen with (a) wrong sector order, (b) overtime/working hours, (c) missing evidence files."
3.  "We don’t install software. You send your sheet monthly; we send back a PDF report + fix list + audit ID."
4.  "We start with **Rs 5,000 setup** to map your sheet and lock scope; then monthly."
5.  "I’ll WhatsApp you a sample report now — what’s the best email?"

### Objection Killers
*   **"We already have an accountant"** → "Great. We complement them by producing the **inspection evidence pack** + monthly risk flags."
*   **"We don’t want trouble"** → "Exactly why you want a monthly audit trail."
*   **"Too expensive"** → "Back-pay + disruption costs more. Start Tier 1 and upgrade later."
