# Titan Automation Agency Strategy
**Objective:** Productize n8n workflows to generate $83k/mo ($1M/yr).

## The Model
- **Setup Fee:** $750 - $2,500 (one-time)
- **Retainer:** $250 - $1,000/mo (monitoring)

## Targets
- **Base:** 20 clients @ $500/mo = $10k/mo.
- **Sprint:** 10 installs/week = $40k/mo.
- **Scale:** Referrals + Ads -> $80k+/mo.

## Risks & Mitigations
1. **Template Hell:**
   - *Fix:* "Gold Pack" of 12 proven, standardized workflows.
2. **Compliance:**
   - *Fix:* Least-privilege tokens, client-side data retention where possible.
3. **Quality Variance:**
   - *Fix:* Validator script (Titan) to check credentials/nodes before offering.
4. **Distribution:**
   - *Fix:* "Offer" driven ("We install & maintain"), not just a library.

## Supply Chain (Workflow Sources)
1. **Zie619 (Primary):** General purpose, ~2k workflows.
2. **Enescingoz/Awesome-n8n:** **AI-First** focus (Gmail, Telegram, LLMs).
3. **Wassupjay:** **Vector/RAG** focus (Embeddings, Pinecone).
4. **Danitilahun:** Large organized collection (~2k).
5. **Egouilliard:** Advanced AI agents & social automation.

## Operational Plan
1. **Ingest:** TITAN indexes the `Zie619` library.
2. **Validate:** Automated checks for "High Value" vs "Junk".
3. **Sell:** Pick 1 niche (Retail/Logistics) and offer "Missed-lead recovery + WhatsApp".
4. **Observe:** All workflows log to `az_runs` via Supabase for centralized monitoring.
